## Recommended Architecture

### Small Scale (< 1 Gbps)

Single node deployment with Docker Compose:
- 1 Gateway + Worker combined node
- External PostgreSQL and Redis

### Medium Scale (1-10 Gbps)

3-5 node Kubernetes cluster:
- 2 dedicated Gateway replicas
- 3 Worker nodes with XDP
- Managed PostgreSQL and Redis

### Large Scale (10+ Gbps)

Multi-region deployment:
- GeoDNS for global routing
- Multiple Kubernetes clusters per region
- Dedicated database clusters
- CDN integration for static assets

## Hardware Requirements

### Worker Nodes (XDP Processing)

| Traffic | CPU | RAM | NIC |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|
| 1 Gbps | 4 cores | 8 GB | 10G NIC |
| 10 Gbps | 16 cores | 32 GB | 25G NIC |
| 40 Gbps | 32 cores | 64 GB | 100G NIC |

### Gateway Nodes

| Requests/sec | CPU | RAM |
|--------------|-----|-----|
| 10,000 | 2 cores | 4 GB |
| 50,000 | 8 cores | 16 GB |
| 100,000+ | 16 cores | 32 GB |

## Network Requirements

- Public IP addresses for edge nodes
- Low-latency connection to backend servers
- Anycast or GeoDNS for global distribution
- BGP peering (optional, for large deployments)
