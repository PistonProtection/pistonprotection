  <Card title="Minecraft Bedrock" description="RakNet protection with amplification prevention" href="/docs/protocols/minecraft-bedrock" />
  <Card title="HTTP/1-3" description="Layer 7 HTTP protection with rate limiting" href="/docs/protocols/http" />

  <Card title="TCP/UDP" description="Generic L4 protection for any protocol" href="/docs/protocols/tcp-udp" />
</Cards>

## Protection Features

All protocols support these common features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Rate Limiting | Token bucket rate limiting per IP/subnet |
| Geo Blocking | Block or allow traffic by country |
| IP Reputation | Automatic scoring based on behavior |
| Connection Limits | Maximum connections per IP |
| Bandwidth Limits | Maximum bandwidth per backend |

## Protocol-Specific Detection

Each protocol has tailored attack detection:

| Protocol | Attack Types Detected |
|----------|----------------------|
| Minecraft Java | Bot joins, handshake floods, packet spam, state attacks |
| Minecraft Bedrock | RakNet amplification, ping floods, MOTD abuse |
| HTTP | Slowloris, HTTP floods, header injection, request smuggling |
| QUIC | Version negotiation attacks, retry storms, token abuse |
| TCP | SYN floods, ACK floods, RST attacks, slow read |
| UDP | Amplification, fragmentation, port scanning |
